### Git Clone
To do a basic clone of the project execute:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MattJNuval/SustainableTripPlannerAndNavigationApp.git
```
in a terminal.

## Server-side
The server-side is not the application itself, but rather a seperate application that helps to process the actual (client) application's requests such as routing. This contributes to a server-client relationship.

[Server](ServerSide)

## Client-side
The client-side is the application itself that communicates with the server-side.

[Client](SustainabilityApp)
